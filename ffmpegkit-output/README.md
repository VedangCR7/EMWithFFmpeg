# FFmpegKit Build Output - SUCCESSFUL BUILD!

## 🎉 Build Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

This package contains the successfully built FFmpegKit libraries for Android.

## ✅ Built Architectures

- **android-arm-lts** - ARM 32-bit (armeabi-v7a)
- **android-arm-neon-lts** - ARM 32-bit with NEON optimization (armeabi-v7a-neon)  
- **android-arm64-lts** - ARM 64-bit (arm64-v8a)
- **android-x86-lts** - Intel 32-bit (x86)
- **android-x86_64-lts** - Intel 64-bit (x86_64)

## 📦 Contents

Each architecture directory contains:
- `ffmpeg/lib/` - Core FFmpeg libraries (.so files)
- `ffmpeg/include/` - Header files for development
- `ffmpeg/share/` - Documentation and configuration files

## 🔧 Key Libraries Available

- **libavcodec.so** - Video/audio codecs
- **libavformat.so** - Container formats
- **libavfilter.so** - Audio/video filters
- **libavutil.so** - Utility functions
- **libswscale.so** - Video scaling
- **libswresample.so** - Audio resampling
- **libavdevice.so** - Device interfaces

## 🚀 Usage in React Native

1. Copy the appropriate .so files from the desired architecture
2. Place them in your React Native project's `android/app/src/main/jniLibs/` directory
3. Create subdirectories for each architecture:
   - `armeabi-v7a/` (from android-arm-lts)
   - `arm64-v8a/` (from android-arm64-lts)  
   - `x86/` (from android-x86-lts)
   - `x86_64/` (from android-x86_64-lts)
